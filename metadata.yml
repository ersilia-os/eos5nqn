Title: GNEProp Escherichia coli antibiotic activity
Description: The GNEProp model was trained based on a high-throughput screening 
  effort against a sensitized Escherichia coli strain. The model was able to 
  identify new antibiotic candidates in a billion-scale screening effort. 
  small-molecule high-throughput screening with a deep-learning-based virtual 
  screening approach to uncover new antibacterial compounds. Robustness of the 
  model was validated with respect to out-of-distribution generalization and 
  activity cliff prediction.
